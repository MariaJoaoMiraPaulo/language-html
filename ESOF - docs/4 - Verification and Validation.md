## Test Statistics and analytics
The statistics related to Atom's tests are available in the ReadMe of Atom. As explained before Atom uses Jasmine as its spec framework, and 3 online platforms (CircleCi, Travis Ci and AppVeyor) to perform the build and run its tests.

Atom tests run in 3 fases:
- Executes core main process tests:
  23 passing tests.
- Executes core render process tests:
  - [CircleCi](https://circleci.com/gh/atom/atom/2092#tests/containers/0) finished in 319.954 seconds 2027 tests, 7730 assertions, 0 failures, 0 skipped;
  - [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Atom/atom/build/job/2y4kak3pr4npq0cg) took 194.545 seconds to run 2013 tests, resulting in 7645 assertions and 0 failures;
- Executes benchmark tests;
